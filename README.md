### Terminology

The word *put* is used when a Task is physically scheduled into a time slot. For example, when a user schedules 
a meeting specifically for 5 pm - 6 pm on a Wednesday, then within the scope of this program this is called *putting* 
the meeting into the 5 pm - 6 pm slot in the Wednesday Day object. Variable and method names as well as their 
accompanying description comments will reflect this definition.

The word *schedule* is used when an optimal time is being found for a Task (specifically a NonFixedTask) using this
program's `scheduleTask` algorithm. For example,
when a user wants our program to schedule their math homework in the optimal time slot before their
already-scheduled math test, then this Task is being *scheduled* into the Week object. Variable and method names as well as their
accompanying description comments will reflect this definition.
